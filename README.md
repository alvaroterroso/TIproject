# TIproject
This code was produced by me, and two other brilliant UC students.
This is an implementation of the deflate LZ77 algorithm.
Used as final project of Information Theory discipline, this work had a 9.42/10 grade. 
Notice that FAQ.txt.gz is used as a test file for the code. 
If you want to try yourself use: "$gzip <testfile.txt> testfilezip.gz", this will gzip your file.
Use it freely, always respecting your sources.
